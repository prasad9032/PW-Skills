        you are in the world.<br>Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort,
        and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving
        you valuable information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics on usage and
        demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you discover new fonts that have been vetted and
        organized by our team of designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes fonts based on
        popularity, trends, and your geographic location.<br> You can also create your own highly customized collections
        by
        filtering families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy. Collections can be
        shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout
        the design and engineering process.<br> In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog, expanding
        expressive
        capability for our users. Our first set was the Material icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for
        common communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital products for Android, iOS, and
        web.All the fonts and icons in our catalog are open source and available to anyone, making beautiful typography
