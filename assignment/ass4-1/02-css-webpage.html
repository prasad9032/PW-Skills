    <h1>CSS(Cascading Style Sheet)</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
        CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at
        CERN.Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on
        public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation
        (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of
        CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

        Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web
        style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style
        sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be
        influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        <br>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
        for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
        one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>

        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
        for CSS documents
