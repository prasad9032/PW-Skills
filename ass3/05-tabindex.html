    <h1>Short note on tabindex</h1>
    <p>The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element when the "tab" button is used for navigating
        The tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not
        necessarily useful.
        The tabindex content attribute allows authors to control whether an element is supposed to be focusable, whether
        it is supposed to be reachable using sequential focus navigation, and what is to be the relative order of the
        element for the purposes of sequential focus navigation. The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the
        "tab" key to navigate through the focusable elements. The term "tabbing" refers to moving forward through the
        focusable elements that can be reached using sequential focus navigation.</p>
