    <h1>What is entities </h1>
    <p>Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
    and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are
    difficult to type with a standard keyboard. Here are some commonly used entities:</p>

     <ol>
        <li>less than> - greater than</li>
        <li> & - ampersand</li>
        <li>" - double quotation mark</li>
        <li>' - single quotation mark</li>
        <li></li>
     </ol>
