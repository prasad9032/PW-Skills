                <h2>What is html?</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web
                    pages. <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
                    the appearance of the document.
                    HTML has included semantic markup since its inception. In an HTML document, the author may, among
                    other things start with a title add headings and paragraphs add emphasis to thetext add
                    images add links to other pages and use various kinds of lists.</p>

                <h2>what is semantic html?</h2>
                <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
                    web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look.<br> Semantic HTML
                    is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to
                    suggest its presentation to human users.</p>
