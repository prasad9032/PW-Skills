    <h1>Web accessiblity</h1>
    <p>Web accessibility, or eAccessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent
        interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities,<br> situational
        disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed,
        developed and edited, more users have equal access to information and functionality.</p>
