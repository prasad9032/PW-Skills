    <h1>List 3 ways to improve the accessibilty</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Use proper color contrast ratios</strong>
            <p target="oo">Any audio files, such as the sound that accompanies a video, should be available in a different format.
                Closed captions, transcripts, and sign-language interpretation are three ways to help users with
                auditory impairments understand audio content.<br> It’s also good practice to include transcripts for
                people
                who prefer to read or who may be in a situation where they cannot listen to audio (such as when using
                the web at a cafe or at a library).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Include captions and text transcripts</strong>
            <p>Poor color contrast can make it difficult for users with color blindness to read text. The WCAG
                recommends a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text that appears over a background color or image.<br>
                If you don’t have a graphic designer on hand, the easiest way to make sure your site uses proper
                contrast is to use a contrast checker, a tool that scans your site’s text colors and backgrounds.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Remove flickering content</strong>
            <p>Flickering content may trigger seizures for people with disabilities, so it should be removed. It’s also
                considered distracting and annoying,<br> so removing flickering content can help users focus on the purpose
                of your content.</p>
        </li>
