        <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
            structure of web. <br> Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's <br>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
            between websites.<br> Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
            and
            linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

        <dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content
            and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br> This separation can improve content
            accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
            characteristics enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
            separate <br>.css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
            the
            .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
            formatting.</dd>
        <dt><strong>javascript</strong></dt>
        <dd>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br> As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
            JavaScript
            on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br> It
            is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
            application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
            data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</dd>
        <dt><strong>react js</strong></dt>
        <dd>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
            for building user interfaces based on components. <br>It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
            community of individual developers and companies.

            React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
            Next.js.<br> Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
            React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.</dd>
