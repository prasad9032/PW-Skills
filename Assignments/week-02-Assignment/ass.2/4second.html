  <p> Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web
    design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works
    over the internet i.e. websites.
  </p>
  <p></p>Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web
  server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer,
  tablet, or phone.</p>
  <p>Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known is that Web Development is majorly classified into two
    facets: Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously, they both have their respective set of tools
    and technologies. For instance, when we talk about Frontend Development, there always comes 3 names first and
    foremost – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend (or you can say
    server-side) programming language to make the website function along with various other tools & technologies such as
    databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.

  </p>
  <p>Whenever there is a talk of web development – most probably, 9 out of 10 times the name of JavaScript comes in the
    discussion. As per the annual reports of various popular platforms like Stack Overflow and Octoverse – JavaScript is
    one of the most preferred and leading programming languages in the tech world. One of the major reasons behind it is
    that the particular language can be used for both – Front End Web Development and Back End Web Development. Looking
    at several past trends and stats, it can be said that the popularity of Node.js has somehow increased the usage of
    JavaScript as a backend language for web development. Meanwhile, the language provides you with several remarkable
    features for backend development such as Light-weight Scripting language, Dynamic Typing, Interpreted,
    Object-Oriented programming support, Client-Side Validation, Huge community support, and many more. </p>
