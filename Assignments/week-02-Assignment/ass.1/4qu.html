    <h2>1.paragraph tag</h2>
    <p>HTML paragraph is a tag which is used to specify a paragraph to be displayed on the webpage. The text between the
        starting
        p tag and the end ptag represents a paragraph in HTML. There is however no need to add a line of separation
        before and after a paragraph<br> since an empty line is added before and after a paragraph by the browser
        itself.
        Including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari and Firefox, all the popular browsers supports the HTML
        paragraph
        tag.</p>
    <h2>2.Anchor tag</h2>
    <p>An anchor tag is a HTML element that creates a link to a target URL. When correctly implemented, the link can
        wrap around text, images, or as buttons, so that users can interact with it and visit the link's
        destination.<br> It
        is a best practice to provide context about the link's destination, either in the form of clear anchor text or
        with a descriptive image. This way, website visitors know what to expect, and Search Engine crawlers can
        understand the connection across both URLs</p>
    <h2>3.image tag</h2>
    <p>image tags anchor the image so it appears in relation to other elements on the webpage. You can use image tags to
        configure how the image appears and optimize for both search engine bots and users.
        The tags you use impact your page load speeds, which can affect your website’s user experience.
        All current browsers support these image tag codes, so it won’t matter which browsers you or your visitors use.
        Image tags translate to all browsers for a consistent experience.</p>
