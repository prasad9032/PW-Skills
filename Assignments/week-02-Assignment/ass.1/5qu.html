    <h1>Emmet</h1>
    <p> Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows for faster and more efficient HTML and CSS coding. It allows
        developers to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand notation.<br> which is then expanded into full code by the
        plugin.<br>
        Emmet can be used with HTML. This can be used for creating elements, nesting elements, adding classes and IDs,
        adding attributes, and more.
        Emmet allows for the quick creation of HTML elements using a shorthand notation. For example, using the div
        abbreviation will create a div element, and using p will create a p element.</p>
